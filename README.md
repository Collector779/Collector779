## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **22-year-old cybersecurity student** with a strong interest in **system security, threat analysis, and low-level internals**.  
I focus on understanding how systems work *under the hood* and how they fail when security is done wrong.

I enjoy combining **theory with hands-on practice** — labs, checklists, scripts, and tooling that can be applied immediately.

## ✍️ Blog & Writing — collector-sec.xyz

I run **collector-sec.xyz**, a personal blog focused on **practical cybersecurity**.

On the blog I publish:
- 🛡️ **Step-by-step security guides**
- ✅ **Hardening checklists for servers and services**
- 🚨 **Incident response processes (from detection to recovery)**
- 🔐 **Secure defaults for CI/CD pipelines and access control**
- 🧩 **Code snippets and examples** in:
  - C / C++
  - Python
  - Java
  - JavaScript

The goal is simple: **actionable content**, not theory-only posts.

## 🧪 How I Create Content

- 🧱 I build **labs and test environments** to validate ideas
- 📝 I write **clear, step-by-step guides** with code and reasoning
- 🔗 I connect **what I learn during my studies** with real-world security use cases
- 📦 Whenever possible, I back articles with **GitHub repositories**

## 🚀 Projects & Open Source

I actively work on a variety of projects — not only related to security, but also to operating systems, programming, and general-purpose tooling.  
This section is a work in progress and will be expanded over time with detailed write-ups, technical context, and things I’ll be happy to show off 😉
